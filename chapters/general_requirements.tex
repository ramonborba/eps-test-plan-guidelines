\chapter{General Requirements} \label{ch:general-requirements}

The ECSS-E-ST-10-03 \cite{ecss-e-st-10-03} also defines testing requirements regarding test conditions, test input tolerances, measurement uncertainties and retesting, which are independent of the product (the item for which the standards are being applied), and no specific considerations were deemed necessary considering the EPS module.

These requirement are mostly relevant to environmental tests and, may be referenced directly from the standards document \cite{ecss-e-st-10-03} when applicable.

The standards also define a series of reviews to be held before and after each test.
In the context of a CubeSat mission, holding this many reviews would greatly lengthen mission time, especially if applied at module level testing.
So, at this time, those reviews were not considered applicable.
