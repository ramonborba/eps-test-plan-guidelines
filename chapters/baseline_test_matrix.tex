\chapter{Baseline Test Matrix} \label{ch:baseline-matrix}


The test matrix is where all the selected test for the test plan are presented and organized, it should contain or reference all the relevant information regarding each test.

Regarding the test program, the test matrix, presented in \autoref{tab:baseline-test-matrix} is proposed as a baseline.
It is intended to be applicable to different EPS architectures and cover most of the necessary tests.
When writing a specific test plan, the relevant test activities applicable to the architecture as well as to the requirements of the EPS being tested should be selected.
Also, any additional tests, specific to a given architecture, not covered in the baseline matrix, may be added as necessary.

The baseline test matrix is organized in five test blocks: inspection, functional, performance, mission and environmental.
Each block is composed of related test activities, and each activity is composed of one or more individual tests.
Each individual test should referenced to its specifications, procedures, model used and requirement being verified.

At individual test level, the dependencies on the specifics of each EPS architecture and implementation are greatly increased, so proposing individual tests at this moment is unfeasible considering this matrix, and the entire guidelines document, is intended to be adaptable to different topologies and architectures.

In the specific test plan, this matrix would need additional columns to include all the necessary information, and, for better organization, may be divided into multiple tables, as long as the tests are properly referenced.

In the next sections, a description of each block and activity will be presented.

\section{Performance}

The Performance test block has the objective of verifying and evaluating the performance aspects of the module in relation to its requirements.
The main focus of this block, considering and EPS module, is on evaluating the efficiency of the multiple conversion stages present in the module, as well as of the module as a hole.
This usually consists of applying varying loads to the regulators and measuring input and output power consumptions in order to calculate the efficiency, resulting in an efficiency curve, providing data for different points of operation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Module Power Consumption:

\end{itemize}



\section{Mission}

The Mission test block has the objective of verifying the correct operation of the module in relation to the mission concept of operations.
The activities of this block will involve simulations of expected scenarios during mission operation, considering what is feasible to simulate on ground.
These may include, for example, system initialization, payload activation schedule, eclipse situations and other relevant scenarios.
It is also included simulations of contingency situations, and time critical scenarios.
Due to the nature of this block, the test activities will be highly dependent on the specifics of each mission, and so no specific activities or scenarios are proposed at this moment.


\section{Environmental}

The Environmental test block has the objective of verifying that the module is capable of surviving and operating on the conditions of the environment it is exposed to.

The activities involve vibration tests, which relates to the launch conditions, and thermal vacuum, thermal cycling and bake-out tests, which relate to the space and orbit conditions;
Specific details for these tests, including test levels and durations, are defined directly in the ECSS-E-ST-10-03 standard \cite{ecss-e-st-10-03}. The requirements of the launch provider, when known, must also be taken into account and take precedence over the standards.
